# lichess_analytics
Small scripts to stalk and occasionally troll lichess players.


Todo:
- Maintain some form of history of the evolution of the number of games, perhaps the api lets us get that
- Email the player if thay are on a winning/loosing streak, or if they are abusing of Lichess


Disclaimer: This is intended for use on friends only, and for motivation :).
